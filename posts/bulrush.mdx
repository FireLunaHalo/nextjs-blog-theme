Bulrush was once a simple toad from a quiet part of the swamp. The tranquility of his home was shattered when a predator threatened his peaceful life. Without thinking, Bulrush picked up a fallen branch to defend his family, discovering his natural prowess for combat.

Dedicating himself to the warrior's path, he honed his skills and strength, his weapon of choice becoming the broadsword. His bravery and determination in defending his home earned him the title "the Bold."

Bulrush has become an inspiration for his people, his fearless charge into battle a beacon of hope. He lives by the warrior's code, defending his home and loved ones with unyielding resolve.

## Special Ability: Swampblade Strike
Swampblade Strike is Bulrush's signature move. With a powerful swing of his broadsword, he can unleash a wave of energy that takes the form of a surging tidal wave, damaging and slowing all enemies in its path. The wave carries with it the essence of the swamp, and enemies struck by it find their movements sluggish, as if wading through a marsh. It's an ability that requires a great deal of physical strength and is used sparingly, often as a trump card in battles.
