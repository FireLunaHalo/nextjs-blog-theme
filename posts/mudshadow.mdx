## Special Ability: Shadowstep

In the blink of an eye, Mudshadow can blend into the shadows and reappear in another nearby location. This incredible agility and speed make him exceptionally elusive, allowing him to bypass obstacles or enemies, and position himself advantageously on the battlefield. Whether it's getting behind enemy lines or making a quick escape, Shadowstep exemplifies Mudshadow's roguish finesse. It is a testament to his background as a master of stealth from the mysterious realms of the Enigma Swamps. This ability can only be used a limited number of times per day, and it requires a moment of concentration to activate, making it a precious resource Mudshadow uses wisely.
