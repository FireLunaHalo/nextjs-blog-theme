In the depths of the swamplands, under the vast canopy of verdant ferns and towering swamp oaks, dwells Cattail Quill, the silent guardian of the marshes. His home is a place of natural harmony and eerie beauty, a place that many in the land dare not venture, for it is teeming with untamed creatures and treacherous terrain.

But Cattail Quill was born and bred in this thriving wetland. He is not just a ranger; he is a piece of the swamp, a living embodiment of its mystery and wild charm. His skin is colored in the same palette as the varied foliage of the marshes, and his eyes, ever watchful, have witnessed the life cycle of the swamplands time and time again.

Cattail Quill's life was one of peaceful solitude until the day the corruption seeped into his beloved swamp. It twisted the creatures into monstrous versions of themselves and turned the once lush vegetation into a festering wasteland. He watched in helpless horror as the land he swore to protect fell victim to this insidious plague.

The corruption fueled his resolve, igniting a fire in him that even the dampest swamp couldn't extinguish. Cattail Quill took up his cattail-spiked arrows and his sturdy swamp oak longbow and swore an oath to purge the corruption from his home. His arrows became the extensions of his will, each shot a declaration of his unwavering commitment to restoring his land to its former glory.

Cattail Quill fights not just for himself, but for every creature and plant within the swamplands. He is their guardian, their champion, their last hope. And he won't let them down.

## Special Ability: Corruption Wave
Cattail Volley is a unique and formidable ability mastered by Cattail Quill. Drawing from his deep bond with his swamp home, Cattail Quill uses his knowledge of the terrain to his advantage.
With a swift movement, he plucks a handful of cattails from the ground, their velvety heads ripe and bursting with fluffy seeds. With a swift and elegant motion, he places the cattails onto his bowstring and pulls it back, aiming high into the air. Then, with a deep breath and a silent prayer to the swamp spirits, he releases the bowstring.
The cattails fly high into the air, breaking apart at the apex of their trajectory. A shower of sharp, hardened seeds rain down on his opponents, piercing like a volley of arrows. The sudden and wide-reaching attack is usually unexpected, providing Cattail Quill with the element of surprise and offering him a chance to either make a strategic retreat or follow up with a more direct attack.
Cattail Volley is a testament to Cattail Quill's ingenuity, turning the simple flora of the swamp into a deadly weapon. It's an ability that represents his determination and resourcefulness in his fight against the corruption plaguing his home.
