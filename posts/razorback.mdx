In the harsh and unforgiving wilds of the Toadlands, only the strongest survive. For Razorback the Savage, life has always been a battle. Born into the Savage Spur, a tribe known for its fierce warriors, Razorback was destined for a life of conflict.

As a tadpole, Razorback was larger and stronger than his peers, and as he grew, so too did his lust for battle. He was a natural warrior, with a fiery spirit and an insatiable hunger for victory. He would spend his days training, pushing his body to its limits, and his nights dreaming of glory on the battlefield.

His dreams became reality when he was chosen to lead his tribe into war against the encroaching Predators from the north. Razorback fought with unmatched ferocity, his axe cutting a bloody swath through the enemy ranks. He became a figure of fear, his name whispered in hushed tones amongst his enemies.

But victory came at a cost. The horrors of war weighed heavily on Razorback. He was a hero to his people, but he felt himself becoming something else. Something darker. The line between hero and beast blurred, and he found himself reveling in the chaos of battle, the thrill of the kill. He was becoming a Scourge.

Now, Razorback wanders the Toadlands, a hero turned villain. His savage nature and thirst for battle have corrupted him, and he now fights not for honor or glory, but for the sheer thrill of the fight. And though he is feared and shunned by many, there is no denying his prowess on the battlefield. For when Razorback the Savage goes to war, nothing can stand in his way.
