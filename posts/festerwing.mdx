title: Festerwing the Plaguebringer
description: "Festerwing the Plaguebringer is a dreaded figure of nightmares, embodying the terrors of the swamp. He stands at a hulking 6 feet, his massive form radiating a malignant aura. His skin is a sickly mix of dull purples and putrid greens, a symbol of the virulent plagues he carries. His eyes, devoid of any mercy, glow a baleful red in the shadows of his dwelling. Clad in ragged, moss-laden robes that blend into the swamp's sickly palette, Festerwing carries a gnarled staff, adorned with strange, gleaming symbols that seem to seethe with malevolent power."

Festerwing was once a humble healer among his tribe, utilizing his deep knowledge of the swamp's flora to cure illnesses and mend wounds. However, his thirst for knowledge led him down a dark path, as he began to experiment with dangerous and forbidden mixtures. Over time, he became infatuated with the power of decay and corruption.

One fateful night, Festerwing consumed a potion of his own making, intending to understand the essence of corruption itself. Instead, he was transformed into a horrific embodiment of the very corruption he sought to understand. His skin turned to a sickly hue, his eyes glowing with a cruel and unnatural light.

Now, Festerwing walks the swamps as the Plaguebringer, wielding his dreadful staff to spread corruption wherever he goes. Few dare to approach him, and those who do seldom return without a trace of corruption touching their soul. Despite the horror he has become, Festerwing views his transformation not as a curse, but as a twisted form of enlightenment. He revels in his newfound power and sees himself as the ultimate harvester of corruption in the swamp.

## Special Ability: Corruption Wave
With a wave of his clawed hand, Festerwing can unleash a tide of corruption that weakens his enemies and saps their will to fight. The Corruption Wave reduces the Strength and Agility of all opponents in play by 1 for the next two turns, making them more susceptible to attacks. However, as potent as this ability is, it requires a significant amount of Festerwing's energy to cast. Consequently, he can only use this ability once every three turns. Festerwing's Corruption Wave embodies his cruel joy in spreading decay and sows despair among his enemies, making him a terrifying adversary on the battlefield.
